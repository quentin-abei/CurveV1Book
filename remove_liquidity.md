Here's a breakdown of the `remove_liquidity` function in Vyper:

```solidity
def remove_liquidity(_amount: uint256, min_amounts: uint256[N_COINS]):
    total_supply: uint256 = self.token.totalSupply()
    amounts: uint256[N_COINS] = empty(uint256[N_COINS])
    fees: uint256[N_COINS] = empty(uint256[N_COINS])  # Fees are unused but we've got them historically in event

    for i in range(N_COINS):
        value: uint256 = self.balances[i] * _amount / total_supply
        assert value >= min_amounts[i], "Withdrawal resulted in fewer coins than expected"
        self.balances[i] -= value
        amounts[i] = value

        # "safeTransfer" which works for ERC20s which return bool or not
        _response: Bytes[32] = raw_call(
            self.coins[i],
            concat(
                method_id("transfer(address,uint256)"),
                convert(msg.sender, bytes32),
                convert(value, bytes32),
            ),
            max_outsize=32,
        )  # dev: failed transfer
        if len(_response) > 0:
            assert convert(_response, bool)  # dev: failed transfer

    self.token.burnFrom(msg.sender, _amount)  # dev: insufficient funds

    log RemoveLiquidity(msg.sender, amounts, fees, total_supply - _amount)
```

- **Function Definition**
  - `remove_liquidity(_amount: uint256, min_amounts: uint256[N_COINS])`: Removes liquidity from the pool.

- **Initialize Variables**
  - `total_supply: uint256`: Total supply of pool tokens.
  - `amounts: uint256[N_COINS]`: Array to store the amount of each coin to be withdrawn.
  - `fees: uint256[N_COINS]`: Array to store fees for each coin (not used in this function but included for historical event logging).

- **Process Withdrawals**
  - For each coin:
    - `value: uint256`: Calculate the amount of each coin to be withdrawn based on the proportion of `_amount` being redeemed.
    - `assert value >= min_amounts[i]`: Ensure the withdrawal amount meets or exceeds the minimum amount specified.
    - Update `self.balances[i]` by subtracting the withdrawn amount.
    - Set `amounts[i]` to the withdrawn amount.
    - Transfer the coins to the sender using `transfer` method.
    - Handle the transfer response to check for success.

- **Burn Pool Tokens**
  - `self.token.burnFrom(msg.sender, _amount)`: Burn the pool tokens from the senderâ€™s account.

- **Log Event**
  - Emit `RemoveLiquidity` event with details of the transaction.

This function handles the removal of liquidity from the pool by updating balances, transferring coins to the sender, and burning the appropriate amount of pool tokens while ensuring sufficient funds are available and transactions are successful.
